# Data packs for Ecliptic Seasons

Here is a repository for datapacks designed for compatibility between [Ecliptic Seasons](https://github.com/joe-vettek/Ecliptic-Seasons ) and other mods.
 If you're using a crop-related datapack, it's recommended to enable **"ForceCompatMode"** in the crop settings if you not sure.

Please note that these datapacks may stop working over time. We does **not actively maintain** this repository, as these are demonstration packs and will not be officially released.
 However, you're welcome to open issues or submit pull requests to share your ideas or contributions.
